# About Me

<img src="/../files/about.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="200" />


Hi! I'm a 3rd year student at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), Pilani campus. I am passionate about open source and software development in general. I am learning Golang these days. I have recently discovered graphics programming and will start exploring it! I occasionally watch anime as well. My favourite anime series is [Your Lie in April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Lie_in_April) :)

This summer, I'm contributing to [Metabrainz Foundation](https://metabrainz.org/) in the Google Summer of Code program. I am also interning at a startup - [CultureVo](https://www.culturevo.com/) focussed on building an AI companion who understands you culturally and emotionally.

I have previously worked as an SDE intern at [LEAD School](https://leadschool.in/).

My team also ranked first at the Bank of Baroda Hackathon 2024.
